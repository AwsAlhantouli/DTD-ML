DTD Image Classification

This project focuses on Image Classification using the Describable Textures Dataset (DTD). The dataset contains 47 unique texture categories, such as 'striped', 'cracked', and 'marbled', which are used to train a model to automatically classify textures in images.
Project Overview

In this project, I explore and implement various deep learning and transfer learning models, specifically focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify texture images. The goal is to achieve high classification accuracy by leveraging pretrained models and fine-tuning them for the DTD dataset.
Key Features:

    47 Texture Categories: The dataset consists of images categorized into 47 distinct texture classes. Each image contains a single texture pattern.

    Deep Learning Models: I explored different models, including VGG16, ResNet, and MobileNet, applying transfer learning to improve classification performance while reducing training time.

    Model Performance: The final model achieved a robust accuracy score, showcasing the potential of transfer learning in real-world image classification tasks.

    Data Augmentation: Various augmentation techniques were applied to enhance the model's ability to generalize across different texture patterns.

Technologies Used:

    Python
    TensorFlow / Keras
    Matplotlib for visualization
    NumPy and Pandas
    OpenCV for image processing

Project Goals:

    Apply transfer learning to enhance classification performance with less training data.
    Explore different deep learning architectures and fine-tune them for the DTD dataset.
    Visualize the results using confusion matrices and other performance metrics.
